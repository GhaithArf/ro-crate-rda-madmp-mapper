    "description": "The aim of the project is to develop an algorithm that is capable to calculate the amount of sunny („nice“) hours of a day based on data collected by solar thermal collectors used to heat up homes. To evaluate the algorithm we will use the data collected by an owner of a solar thermal collector system based in Vienna, Austria. The output of this evaluation should be a\ngraph that tells us how many hours of the day could be considered as sunny with the plotted data in csv files to allow future analysis.",
